Takes XY coordiantes of goal and robot, finds movement vector in that field.

(Will need to do the same for all fields, then add the resulting vectors together)


Then tranforms vector into a square coordiantes to indacte the displacement of the robot

Then adds displacemtn to the robot's current coordinates to make it move.
